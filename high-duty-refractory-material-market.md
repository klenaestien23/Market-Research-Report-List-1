<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Duty Refractory Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shaped High-duty Refractory</li><li>Unshaped High-duty Refractory</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-duty refractory material market is divided into two main types: shaped and unshaped high-duty refractories. Shaped high-duty refractories are pre-formed products, like bricks and tiles, designed for specific applications, offering durability and strength in high-temperature environments. Unshaped high-duty refractories, on the other hand, are composed of raw materials that can be molded into desired shapes on-site, providing flexibility in application. Both types are essential in industries such as metallurgy, ceramics, and glass for efficient thermal management.</p></p>
