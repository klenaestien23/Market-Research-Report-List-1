<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The User Authentication Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Factor Authentication</li><li>Two Factor Authentication</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The User Authentication Solution market is primarily categorized into Single Factor Authentication (SFA) and Two Factor Authentication (2FA). SFA relies on one verification method, typically a password, making it simple but less secure. Conversely, 2FA enhances security by requiring two distinct forms of verification, such as a password and a one-time code sent to a mobile device. As cyber threats increase, businesses increasingly adopt 2FA solutions to strengthen access security, reflecting a growing shift toward more robust authentication methods.</p></p>
