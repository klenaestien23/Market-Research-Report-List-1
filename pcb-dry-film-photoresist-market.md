<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Dry Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Dry Film Photoresist</li><li>Negative Dry Film Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCB dry film photoresist market consists of two main types: positive and negative dry film photoresists. Positive dry film photoresists become soluble in the developer solution when exposed to UV light, allowing the unexposed areas to be etched away, creating precise patterns. In contrast, negative dry film photoresists harden upon exposure, making the exposed areas insoluble while the unexposed parts are removed. Both types are essential for photolithography in printed circuit board manufacturing, influencing efficiency and design accuracy.</p></p>
